"""Data quality framework.

The runner and the report writer are provided. ONE example rule is implemented
so you can see the shape. The rest is yours.

Design intent: a data quality rule is *data*, not a branch in a function. A
sustainability controller who does not write Python should be able to read
RULES and understand what is being checked and what happens when it fails.
